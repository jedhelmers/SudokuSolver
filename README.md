#Welcome to the Sudoku Solver project

##The Rundown
Sudoku Solver allows a user to snap a picture of a particularly challenging sudoku puzzle and get the puzzle key almost instantly.

The primary piece of wizardry visually processes a grid of data then does something with it. For the time being, I'm borrowing a sudoku solver from an outside source (Borrowed from https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/python/sudoku/sudoku_v105.py). It's not ideal for how I expect the data to come in from the image processing step, but now it should work. Afterwards, I'll move onto building my own solver.
